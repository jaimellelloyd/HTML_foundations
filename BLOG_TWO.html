        <h2>Understanding JavaScript</h2>
        <p>Posted by <strong>Lloyd</strong></p>

        <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>JavaScript</strong> often abbreviated as <strong>JS</strong>,
          is a <em>programming language</em> and core technology of the World
          Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on
          the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party
          libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine
          to execute the code on users' devices.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>JavaScript</strong> is a high-level, often just-in-time
          compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has
          dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class
          functions. It is multiparadigm, supporting event-driven, functional,
          and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
          interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions,
          standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
        </p>

        <p>
          The <strong>ECMAScript</strong> standard does not include any
          input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
          facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system
          provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
        </p>

        <p>
          JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are
          now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The
          most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js. Although Java
          and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard
          libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in
          design.

        <h3>Website Client-side Usage</h3>
        <p>
          JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web,
          with 99% of all websites using it for this purpose.[10] Scripts are
          embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM.
        </p>

        <p>
          All major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes
          the code on the user's device.
        </p>

        <p>Examples of Scripted Behavior</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Loading new web page content without reloading the page, via Ajax or
            a WebSocket. For example, users of social media can send and receive
            messages without leaving the current page.
          </li>

          <li>
            Web page animations, such as fading objects in and out, resizing,
            and moving them.
          </li>

          <li>Playing browser games.</li>

          <li>Controlling the playback of streaming media.</li>

          <li>Generating pop-up ads or alert boxes.</li>

          <li>
            Validating input values of a web form before the data is sent to a
            web server.
          </li>

          <li>
            Logging data about the user's behavior then sending it to a server.
            The website owner can use this data for analytics, ad tracking, and
            personalization.
          </li>

          <li>Redirecting a user to another page.</li>

          <li>
            Storing and retrieving data on the user's device, via the storage or
            IndexedDB standards.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Web Libraries and Frameworks</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>React</strong> (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free
          and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user
          interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly
          Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>React</strong> can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or
          server-rendered applications with frameworks like
          <strong>Next.js</strong>. Because React is only concerned with the
          user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications
          often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side
          functionality. A key advantage of React is that it only rerenders
          those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary
          rerendering of unchanged DOM elements.
        </p>

        <strong>Angular</strong>
        <p>
          <strong>Angular</strong> (also referred to as "Angular 2+") is a
          TypeScript-based, free and open-source single-page web application
          framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of
          individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the
          same team that built AngularJS.
        </p>

        <strong>jQuery</strong>
        <p>
          In 2012, <strong>jQuery</strong> was by far the most popular
          client-side library, used by over 75% of websites. While still in
          widespread use, its popularity has been surpassed by newer libraries
          and frameworks.
        </p>

        <strong>Vanilla JS</strong>
        <p>
          The framework-like moniker <strong>"Vanilla JS"</strong> is term that
          has been coined for websites not using any libraries or frameworks at
          all, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.
